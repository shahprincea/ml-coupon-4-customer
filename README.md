“Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

##Bar Coupons

In this section, we investigate bar coupons to determine the most effective use of our couponing budget by targeting specific groups. Our findings include:

	•	The most likely individuals to use the coupons are regular bar-goers. Those who visit the bar more than four times a month are the highest proportion of coupon users. (Graph shows that frequent bar visitors use more bar coupons.)
	•	People over the age of 25 are more likely to visit bars. (Graph shows that older individuals who visit bars more use more bar coupons.)
	•	Those without children in their vehicles, especially if not working in farming, forestry, or fishing, are more likely to visit bars when receiving coupons. (Graph shows that frequent bar visitors use more bar coupons.)
	•	Widows and the separated are also somewhat more likely to visit bars. (Leftmost graph shows that frequent bar visitors use more bar coupons.)

##Section Two: Coffeehouse Coupons

In this section, we conduct an independent investigation on coffee shop coupons. Our findings are:

	•	Frequent coffee shop visitors are more likely to use the coupon compared to less frequent visitors. (Graph shows that frequent coffee shop visitors use more coupons.)
	•	People living 5 to 15 minutes from the coffee shop are more likely to accept the coupons. (Top right and bottom left graphs.)
	•	Coupons are more likely to be used on days with sunny weather around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. (Bottom right graph shows that people within a range visit more.)
	•	The highest likelihood of coupon use is around 10 AM, with a noticeable increase around 2 PM. (Top left graph.)
	•	Individuals under 26 are more likely to accept the coupons. (Top right graph shows that people within a range visit more.)

###Summary

There are more insights to be derived from the charts, but these are the most useful. By combining several of these categories, we can identify a small yet effective group to target, with about two-thirds of this group responding positively to coupon delivery, thus optimizing the associated costs.

##Next Steps

To maximize customer acquisition while minimizing marketing expenses, the following steps are recommended:

	1.	Calculate the cost per successful coupon delivery from previous marketing campaigns.
	2.	Use this cost to determine the maximum number of purchasable coupons.
	3.	Deliver the optimal ratio of coupons purchased to coupons used.

If sending coupons has no cost, the best strategy is to distribute them to as many people as possible, focusing on the largest groups that
